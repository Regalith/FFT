This visualizer was made by Jason Whitehouse. 

It uses frequency spectrum and output data to modify a LineRenderer into the visualizer you see. The data is processed, smoothed, and combined with a pulsing sine wave to make a more interesting and fluid effect. The color smoothly changes over time between customizable color sets. It also uses post processing effects (assuming you have Unity Pro) to make it more visually appealing.

To get started, just drag an audio file into the AudioSource on the Visualizer object.
